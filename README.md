# PDF Merger Automation Project in Python

## What is it?

This is a simple but extremely useful project that automates the collection of multiple PDF files into a single document. Instead of wasting time copying, pasting, or trying to deal with websites full of ads and extra costs, the solution you find here does everything automatically and in a totally efficient way.

## Why was it created?

The idea behind this project came from the need to improve a simple but recurring task in my daily life. Many times, when I started to merge PDF files, I ended up resorting to online sites — sites that, in addition to being full of ads, often disabled a paid version to have basic functionalities. I knew I could create a solution that not only saved time, but was also 100% free, safe and hassle-free.

## How was it created?

This project was developed with **Python**, a programming language. I used a very practical library called **PyPDF2**, which makes it easier to manipulate PDFs, allowing you to merge multiple files in just a few lines of code. The experience of building this project was an excellent opportunity to learn and put into practice the knowledge I had acquired about Python.

## What was the environment used to create the automation?

- **Python**: Use Python, a language that is easy to understand and has a large community of support, to create the automation.
- **VS Code**: The VS Code development environment, which offers a clean and intuitive interface for programming, as well as many features that facilitate the transfer process.
- **Git**: I used Git to version the code and ensure that the project's evolution is well documented and easy to share.

## Why is it worth it?

Although it is a beginner's project, the solution offers great value in everyday life. It solves a simple problem quickly and effectively, without the need for external tools that can be complex, full of ads or even paid. PDF privacy is something that can be done in just a few minutes, but saves hours of work in the long run. For beginners, it’s a great introduction to task automation and a practical way to put Python into practice.

If you’re new to Python or want to automate simple tasks in a practical way, this project is a great way to learn while solving a real-world problem quickly and efficiently.
